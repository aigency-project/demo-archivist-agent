Google ADK Authentication Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure authentication for Google ADK applications.

OAUTH 2.0 SETUP
===============

Step 1: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
- Go to Google Cloud Console
- Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
- Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
- Select application type (Web, Desktop, Mobile)
- Configure authorized redirect URIs

Step 2: Download Credentials File
- Download the JSON credentials file
- Store it securely in your project
- Never commit credentials to version control

Step 3: Initialize OAuth Flow
- Use the credentials file to initialize OAuth
- Handle the authorization flow
- Store refresh tokens securely

SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION
==============================

For server-to-server authentication:

1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Generate and download the service account key (JSON)
3. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
4. Use the service account for API calls

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
======================

- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use least privilege principle
- Monitor authentication logs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use HTTPS for all communications

TROUBLESHOOTING
==============

Common authentication issues:
- Invalid credentials: Check file path and format
- Expired tokens: Implement token refresh logic
- Insufficient permissions: Review IAM roles
- Network issues: Check firewall and proxy settings
